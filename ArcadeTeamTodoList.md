# Introduction #

A todo list for the arcade.

savehighScore should only overwrite with a higher score than the current highscore.

Adding new games to the arcade needs to be more intuitive (maybe a GUI adder instead of manually editing XML)

When a user runs a game, there should be a check to see if the active User has an entry in their userGame XML for that game.  IF not, it should be added so that writing the high score doesn't fail.

GUI team:

---

Show user the error when attempting to send a message to a nonexistent user.

Auto-refresh the game profile page after new high score is submitted

Add quick-share Twitter and Facebook buttons to game pages

On all games page, make the game list bigger and move the Go button somewhere close to the list
